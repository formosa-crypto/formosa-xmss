- Think about naming for abstract RFC spec, as to prevent clashes with concrete spec
- Substitute THF abstractions for all imperative hash function calls + surrounding address manipulation that cannot be done on security spec side
- Figure out what Hash.prf maps to in security spec and whether to abstract this away under THFs as well, or make this another abstract KHF/THF
- Make XMSS-PRF use random oracle again (renaming it to not have `PRF` in the name) for message compression 
- Discuss: Instantiate `adrs` subtype on security spec side with address type of RFC spec, and
instantiate `val` and `insub` to form the bijection between them? Can this be problematic?
