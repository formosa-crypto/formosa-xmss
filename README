Jasmin & ECLib: release-2025.06

# Working with Docker

We provide a Docker image that installs all the needed
dependencies. Just run:

    make docker

This will create a ready-to-use Docker image and copy the contents of
this archive inside the Docker container.

You can enter the Docker image by running:

    make run-docker

This will give you an interactive shell inside the Docker
container. The working directory will contains a copy of this archive.

To check the proofs, run:

    make -C proof

To run the tests, run:

    make -C test/{subdir} run

where `{subdir}` is one of:

- `sha256`: runs the tests for the SHA-256 implementation.
- `hash`: runs the tests for THASH and other hash-based operations
- `hash_address`: runs the tests for operations on addresses
- `wots`: runs the tests for WOTS+
- `treehash`: runs the tests for Treehash (Jasmin implementation)
- `treehash_new`: runs the tests for a C implementation of Treehash matching the RFC
- `xmss`: runs the tests for XMSS

Before running the tests make sure to clone the submodule by running:

    git submodule update --init 

Additionally, you can check for memory issues with Valgrind by running:

    make -C test/xmss/ check_valgrind

You can also run the benchmarks by running (all benchmarks refer to the XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256 parameter set):

    make -C bench/ {target}.out

where `{target}` is one of:

- `bin/bench_sha256_jasmin`: Benchmarks Jasmin implementation of SHA-2 against OpenSSL,
for input sizes of 32 and 64 bytes. The results are written to the files 
results/sha256_jasmin_ptr.txt, results/sha256_jasmin_32.txt, results/sha256_jasmin_64.txt
results/sha256_openssl_32.txt and results/sha256_openssl_64.txt

- `bin/bench_wots`: Benchmarks the Jasmin and C implementations of WOTS+. The results are written to the files
results/expand_seed_jazz.txt, results/wots_checksum_jazz.txt, results/gen_chain_jazz.txt, 
results/wots_pkgen_jazz.txt, results/wots_sign_jazz.txt, 
results/wots_pk_from_sig_jazz.txt, results/expand_seed_c.txt, 
results/wots_checksum_c.txt, results/gen_chain_c.txt, results/wots_pkgen_c.txt, 
results/wots_sign_c.txt and results/wots_pk_from_sig_c.txt

- `bin/bench_sha2_in_xmss_c`: Benchmarks cycles consumed by SHA-256 (C implementation using OpenSSL SHA-2).
Results are written to results/bench_xmss_sha2_calls_c.csv

- `bin/bench_sha2_in_xmss_jasmin`: Benchmarks cycles consumed by SHA-256 (C implementation using Jasmin's SHA-2).
The difference from bin/bench_sha2_in_xmss_c is that this version uses Jasmin's optimized assembly implementations.
Results are written to results/bench_xmss_sha2_calls_jasmin.csv

- `bin/bench_xmss_impl_c`: Benchmarks the three XMSS-MT API operations: key generation, 
signature generation and verification for the C reference implementation.
Results are written to results/bench_keygen_c.txt, results/bench_sign_c.txt and 
results/bench_verify_c.txt

- `bin/bench_xmss_impl_jasmin`: Benchmarks the three XMSS-MT API operations: key generation,
signature generation and verification for the Jasmin implementation (without zeroization).
Results are written to results/bench_keygen_jasmin.txt, results/bench_sign_jasmin.txt and
results/bench_verify_jasmin.txt

- `bin/bench_xmss_impl_jasmin_zero_loop`: Benchmarks the three XMSS-MT API operations: key generation,
signature generation and verification for the Jasmin implementation with loop-based zeroization.
Results are written to results/bench_keygen_jasmin_zero_loop.txt, results/bench_sign_jasmin_zero_loop.txt and
results/bench_verify_jasmin_zero_loop.txt

- `bin/bench_xmss_impl_jasmin_zero_unroll`: Benchmarks the three XMSS-MT API operations: key generation,
signature generation and verification for the Jasmin implementation with unrolled zeroization.
Results are written to results/bench_keygen_jasmin_zero_unroll.txt, results/bench_sign_jasmin_zero_unroll.txt and
results/bench_verify_jasmin_zero_unroll.txt

- `bin/bench_treehash_c`: Benchmarks the Treehash algorithm for the C reference implementation.
Results are written to results/bench_treehash_c.txt

- `bin/bench_treehash_jasmin`: Benchmarks the Treehash algorithm for the Jasmin implementation.
Results are written to results/bench_treehash_jasmin.txt

Additionally, you can also see the code size for each of the jasmin implementations by running:

    make -C bench/ show_code_size
