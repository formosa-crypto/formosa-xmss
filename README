# Working with Docker

We provide a Docker image that installs all the needed
dependencies. Just run:

    make docker

This will create a ready-to-use Docker image and copy the contents of
this archive inside the Docker container.

You can enter the Docker image by running:

    make run-docker

This will give you an interactive shell inside the Docker
container. The working directory will contains a copy of this archive.

To check the proofs, run:

    opam exec -- make -C proof
