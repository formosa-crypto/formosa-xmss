  Lemma WOTSEncodeP:
  Equivalence for the WOTS checksum, due to the fact that the specification uses
  integers as an intermediate value, requiring consideration of
  endianness in the implementation that would otherwise not be needed.
  Currently, we have reduced this to proving (1)
  bounds on some parameters and (2) equality of the
  values contributed by bits to the integer value (when their
  bitstring is interprted as an integer) before and after
  shift/slice operations.
